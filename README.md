# docx-to-xlsx-converter
A small java desktop app that converts an MS Word ".docx" text file to an MS Excel ".xlsx" table.

The app is parsing the ".docx" text document and creates an Excel table with a new row for every paragraph. 
It removes the empty cells (if any) and the user has an option to limit the number of symbols it gets from each paragraph. 
Note that the app works ONLY for the new MS formats ".docx" and ".xlsx".
